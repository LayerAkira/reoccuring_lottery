Account abstraction in blockchain allows for flexible and customized smart contract execution. Unlike traditional systems, it separates transaction initiation from smart contract execution. Users can create transactions specifying conditions for contract execution, providing:

Flexibility: Users control transaction execution with complex conditions.
Customization: Enables sophisticated smart contracts with user-defined logic.
Reduced Gas Costs: Optimizes transaction fees by specifying contract execution details.

In this repository, we demonstrate how to leverage Account Abstraction (AA) provided by Starknet, showcasing a way to utilize its flexibility and customization features in smart contract execution in regard to reoccurring payments for subscriptions.

In this repository, we offer methods for both users and services to implement a transparent subscription service mechanism.

Some different approaches can be explored in the paper available at: Auto Payments for Self-Custodial Wallets:

We've taken a step further, introducing additional customization for logic and implementing "liquidation-like" mechanics for subscription services.

We believe that our approach, with its emphasis on account abstraction, customizable smart contract execution, and transparent subscription mechanisms, holds the potential for web2 subscription services to eventually leverage our methodology.
